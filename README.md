Agents are growing in popularity and while they do it's important to have a clear and comprehensive list of what they can and more important currently can't do. This repo exists to stay up to date with the latest advancements and use cases in AI Agents.

## Future 

<p> In the future you will be able to hire and employee a Stable Agent for a wide range of tasks. Similar to how companies now use retool to cut time on internal tools, you will use Stable Agents to cut down on the time it takes to complete task without unncessarily hiring. The future billion/trillion dollar companies will be small robust teams, not large organizations</p>

<br>

<p> Organizations will be interested in powering everything with an LLM and to make this possible we will allow organizations that apply to use Stable Agents to generate revenue. Instead of charging a monthly fee or a yearly contract, we will put a cap on the amount of revenue/value a Stable Agent can add to an organization before revenue share is implemented </p>

<p> If you are one of these companies interested in revenue sharing, consider joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/STrYnEDu9U) and type the name of your company in channel <i> #revenue-generating-agnets</i>

## Stable Agents
<p> Stable Agents are agents which are highly capable at complex reasoning. Eventually Stable Agents will be able to complete tasks with little to no supervision. Stable Agents will also be able to add LLM capabilites any non-intelligent software</p>
