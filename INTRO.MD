Agents are growing in popularity and while they do it's important to have a clear and comprehensive list of what they can and more important currently can't do. This repo exists to stay up to date with the latest advancements and use cases in AI Agents.

Contributions to this list are welcome. Before submitting your suggestions, please review the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure your entries meet the criteria. Add links through [pull requests](https://github.com/plowsai/stableagents/pulls) or create an [issue](https://github.com/plowsai/stableagents/issues) to start a discussion.


## Future 

<p> stableagents-ai is a Text2Agent SDK that allows you to create agents that can perform complex tasks using natural language. </p>

<p> The goal of stableagents-ai is to make it easy for developers to create and deploy AI agents that can perform complex tasks with minimal supervision. </p>

<p> stableagents-ai is designed to be the foundation for large-scale AI agent deployments with a focus on reliability, scalability, security, and extensibility. </p>

<p> In the future you will be able to hire and employee a stableagents-ai for a wide range of tasks. Similar to how companies now use retool to cut time on internal tools, you will use stableagents-ai to cut down on the time it takes to complete task without unncessarily hiring. The future billion/trillion dollar companies will be small robust teams, not large organizations</p>

<p> We are building a platform that will allow organizations that apply to use stableagents-ai to generate revenue. Instead of charging a monthly fee or a yearly contract, we will put a cap on the amount of revenue/value a stableagents-ai can add to an organization before revenue share is implemented </p>

## stableagents-ai

<p> stableagents-ai are agents which are highly capable at complex reasoning. Eventually stableagents-ai will be able to complete tasks with little to no supervision. stableagents-ai will also be able to add LLM capabilites any non-intelligent software</p>

### Media Based Agents
- [X] Autoclick "Skip Intro" on a browser based streaming service without having to click it manually. ** Note this could be handled by a selenium script but the idea is to have a stableagents-ai handle it. ** 


### Productivity Agents
- [ ] Create a routine for tasks to be completed autoregressively

- [ ] Assign a task you would normally assign or hire for on a platform like UPWORK. <i>Please note that this is still in early initiation to set proper expectations, stableagents-ai is evovling and can't complete all tasks just yet</i>

### Coding Agents

- [ ] Init stableagents-ai in your terminal to avoid dealing with boilerplate code [ ï¿½ï¿½ Not yet available]
