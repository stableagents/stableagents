# Agent Map - Predictive Response Routing

## Overview
This document outlines how agents use predictive modeling to anticipate and route responses before they occur, enabling more efficient and accurate handling of prompts.

## Flow Architecture

1. Initial Input Processing
   - Agent receives raw prompt/input
   - Analyzes context and intent
   - Identifies key parameters and constraints

2. Predictive Analysis
   - Generates multiple potential response paths
   - Evaluates likelihood of each path
   - Maps dependencies between possible outcomes
   - Identifies critical decision points

3. Hallucination Filtering
   - Applies reality checks to predicted responses
   - Filters out implausible or inconsistent predictions
   - Validates against known constraints
   - Scores confidence of remaining predictions

4. Response Routing
   - Selects optimal response path
   - Prepares fallback options
   - Routes to appropriate agent handlers
   - Monitors execution against predictions

5. Output Generation
   - Constructs final response
   - Validates against original intent
   - Applies any necessary corrections
   - Returns filtered, validated output

## Benefits
- Reduced response latency
- Higher accuracy through pre-filtering
- Better handling of edge cases
- More robust error recovery
- Improved context maintenance

## Implementation Notes
- Requires training on domain-specific scenarios
- Should maintain confidence thresholds for predictions
- Need monitoring of prediction accuracy over time
- Consider computational costs vs benefits
- Regular retraining based on actual outcomes
